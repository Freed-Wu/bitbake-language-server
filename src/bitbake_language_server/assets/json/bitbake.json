A virtual target is a name that corresponds to some particular functionality (e.g. a Linux kernel). Recipes that provide the functionality in question list the virtual target in PROVIDES. Recipes that depend on the functionality in question can include the virtual target in DEPENDS to leave the choice of provider open.\nConventionally, virtual targets have names on the form \u201cvirtual/function\u201d (e.g. \u201cvirtual/kernel\u201d).

This variable tells BitBake which bits to pull for the build and how to pull them. For example, if the recipe or append file needs to fetch a single tarball from the Internet, the recipe or append file uses a SRC_URI entry that specifies that tarball. On the other hand, if the recipe or append file needs to fetch a tarball, apply two patches, and include a custom file, the recipe or append file needs an SRC_URI variable that specifies all those sources.\nThe following list explains the available URI protocols. URI protocols are highly dependent on particular BitBake Fetcher submodules. Depending on the fetcher BitBake uses, various URL parameters are employed. For specifics on the supported Fetchers, see the Fetchers section.\naz://: Fetches files from an Azure Storage account using HTTPS.\nbzr://: Fetches files from a Bazaar revision control repository.\nccrc://: Fetches files from a ClearCase repository.\ncvs://: Fetches files from a CVS revision control repository.\nfile://: Fetches files, which are usually files shipped with the Metadata, from the local machine.
